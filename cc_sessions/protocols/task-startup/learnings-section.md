If the learning system is enabled, load relevant learnings for this task:

### Check Learning System Status

Use the Bash tool to check if learnings are enabled:
```bash
python -m cc_sessions.python.api state show learnings
```

If learnings are enabled and auto_load is true, proceed with loading relevant learnings. Otherwise, skip this step.

### Determine Relevant Topics

**Option 1**: Check if task frontmatter contains `relevant_topics` or `learnings_included`:
- If `learnings_included: true` ‚Üí Learnings already in task file, skip this step
- If `relevant_topics: [list]` ‚Üí Use those topics directly

**Option 2**: If task frontmatter doesn't specify topics, detect them:
```bash
python -m cc_sessions.python.api learnings relevant
```

This will return a list of relevant topics based on keywords and file patterns from the task description.

### Load and Display Learnings

For each relevant topic, load the learnings and present them to the user:

```markdown
[LEARNINGS: Relevant Knowledge Loaded]

üìö **Active Topics**: {list of relevant topics}

{for each topic with learnings:}

### {Topic Name} - Known Patterns

{for each successful pattern in topic:}
- **{pattern.name}** (confidence: {confidence}%, used {use_count} times)
  - {pattern.description}
  - Example: {example_files}
  - Success rate: {success_rate}%

### {Topic Name} - Known Gotchas

{for each file-specific gotcha:}
‚ö†Ô∏è **{file_path}:{line_range}** - {issue}
   Severity: {severity}
   {if solution exists:} ‚Üí Solution: {solution}

{for each general gotcha:}
‚ö†Ô∏è **{gotcha.category}** - {issue}
   Impact: {impact}
   {if solution exists:} ‚Üí {solution}

### {Topic Name} - Anti-Patterns to Avoid

{for each anti-pattern:}
‚ùå **{name}**: {problem}
   {if solution exists:} ‚Üí Use instead: {solution}
   {if example exists:} (seen in: {example_files})

{end for each topic}

**Note**: These learnings come from previous work on similar tasks. They are meant to guide your implementation and help avoid known pitfalls.
```

### Update State

After loading learnings, update the state to track which topics and patterns were loaded:

- Record active_topics in state.learnings.active_topics
- Record loaded patterns with timestamps in state.learnings.loaded_patterns

### Example Output

Here's what a learnings section might look like for an OAuth task:

```markdown
[LEARNINGS: Relevant Knowledge Loaded]

üìö **Active Topics**: sso, security, api

### SSO - Known Patterns

- **Token Refresh Pattern** (confidence: 100%, used 12 times)
  - Always refresh OAuth tokens 5 minutes before expiry to prevent session interruption
  - Example: services/auth.py:45-60
  - Success rate: 100%

- **Async Token Validation** (confidence: 95%, used 8 times)
  - Use async validation with caching to prevent 2s latency on each request
  - Example: middleware/auth.py:120-145
  - Success rate: 100%

### SSO - Known Gotchas

‚ö†Ô∏è **services/auth.py:67** - Missing await on database call causes silent failures
   Severity: critical
   ‚Üí Solution: Always use async/await for database operations in auth flow

‚ö†Ô∏è **OAuth Rate Limiting** - OAuth provider rate limits refresh attempts
   Impact: Users get 429 errors during peak times
   ‚Üí Solution: Implement exponential backoff with 1-second initial delay

### SSO - Anti-Patterns to Avoid

‚ùå **Synchronous Token Validation**: Blocking calls to validation endpoint cause 2s latency per request
   ‚Üí Use instead: Async validation with Redis caching
   (seen in: old_auth.py:89)

‚ùå **Logging Full Tokens**: Security vulnerability if logs are exposed
   ‚Üí Use instead: Log only last 4 characters of tokens
   (seen in: services/logger.py:234)

### Security - Known Patterns

- **Input Sanitization Pattern** (confidence: 90%, used 15 times)
  - Validate and sanitize all user inputs before processing
  - Example: validators/input.py:23-45
  - Success rate: 100%

**Note**: These learnings come from previous work on similar tasks. They are meant to guide your implementation and help avoid known pitfalls.
```

### When No Learnings Exist

If no relevant learnings are found for the detected topics, simply note:

```markdown
[LEARNINGS: No Prior Knowledge]

No learnings have been recorded yet for the relevant topics: {topic_list}

As you complete this task, new patterns and gotchas will be recorded to help with future similar work.
```

### Important Notes

- Only show learnings if the system is enabled (check state.learnings.enabled)
- Only show the top 3-5 patterns/gotchas per topic (avoid overwhelming with information)
- Prioritize by confidence and use_count (most proven patterns first)
- Mark auto-discovered patterns (from codebase scan) with lower confidence
- Critical gotchas should always be shown, regardless of count limits
